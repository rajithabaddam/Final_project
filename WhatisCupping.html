                    <strong>Coffee cupping</strong>, or <i>coffee tasting</i>, is the practice of sampling coffees to distinguish between 
                    different attributes, namely aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, sweetness, body and balance. The 
                    <a href="https://www.coffeeinstitute.org/">Coffee Quality Institute</a> trains "Q graders" (quality graders) 
                    to test for these attributes, as well as uniformity, clean cup and defects. Scores are then aggregated to grade 
                    the coffee on a 100-point scale.

                          The aromatic aspects include Fragrance (defined as the smell of the ground coffee when still dry) and Aroma 
                          (the smell of the coffee when infused with hot water). One can evaluate this at three distinct steps in the 
                          cupping process: (1) sniffing the grounds placed into the cup before pouring water onto the coffee; (2) sniffing 
                          the aromas released while breaking the crust; and (3) sniffing the aromas released as the coffee steeps. Specific 
                          aromas can be noted under "qualities" and the intensity of the dry, break, and wet aroma aspects noted on the 
                          5-point vertical scales. The score finally given should reflect the preference of all three aspects of a sample's 
                          Fragrance/Aroma.

                          the gustatory (taste bud) sensations and retro-nasal aromas that go from the mouth to nose. The score given 
                          for Flavor should account for the intensity, quality and complexity of its combined taste and aroma, 
                          experienced when the coffee is slurped into the mouth vigorously so as to involve the entire palate in the 
                          evaluation.

                                          Clean Cup refers to a lack of interfering negative impressions from first ingestion to final aftertaste, a 
                                            "transparency" of cup. In evaluating this attribute, notice the total flavor experience from the time of 
                                            the initial ingestion to final swallowing or expectoration. Any non-coffee like tastes or aromas will 
                                          disqualify an individual cup. 2 points are awarded for each cup displaying the attribute of Clean Cup.

                                              Acidity is often described as "brightness" when favorable or "sour" when unfavorable. At its best, acidity 
                                              contributes to a coffee's liveliness, sweetness, and fresh- fruit character and is almost immediately 
                                              experienced and evaluated when the coffee is first slurped into the mouth. Acidity that is overly intense 
                                              or dominating may be unpleasant, however, and excessive acidity may not be appropriate to the flavor profile 
                                              of the sample. The final score marked on the horizontal tick-mark scale should reflect the panelist's 
                                              perceived quality for the Acidity relative to the expected flavor profile based on origin characteristics 
                                              and/or other factors (degree of roast, intended use, etc.). Coffees expected to be high in Acidity, such as a 
                                              Kenya coffee, or coffees expected to be low in Acidity, such as a Sumatra coffee, can receive equally high 
                                              preference scores although their intensity rankings will be quite different.
